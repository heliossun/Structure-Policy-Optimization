Please review their code submissions, paying close attention to their problem-solving approach, code structure, readability, and the inclusion of helpful comments.\n\nPlease ensure that the assistants' submissions:\n\n1. Correctly implement the given problem statement.\n2. Contain accurate and efficient code.\n3. Include clear and concise comments that explain the code's logic and functionality.\n4. Adhere to proper coding standards and best practices.\n\nOnce you have carefully reviewed both submissions, provide detailed feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, along with any suggestions for improvement. You should first output a single line containing two scores on the scale of 1-10 (1: no code/no sense; 10: perfect) for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively.
